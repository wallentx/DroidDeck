# gamescope patches carried by the app

Built by `.github/workflows/build-gamescope.yml` on top of the exact gamescope the Linux runtime
ships (3.16.29, Arch Linux ARM's package, same build options), and staged from the apk over
`/usr/local/bin/gamescope` at each session start - the hosted runtime image is never touched.
The binary's shared-library needs are checked against `runtime-sonames.txt`, the runtime's own
library list, before anything is published.

- `0002-steamcompmgr-fallback-appid-focus.patch` - Armada (armada-os/armada), verbatim.
- `0009-fix-arm64-steam-night-mode.patch` - Armada, verbatim: the ARM64 client packs the
  night-mode property differently; the slider did nothing.
- `0019-steamcompmgr-arm64-virtual-white.patch` - Armada, verbatim: the colour-temperature
  slider's (x, y) arrives as one 64-bit element from the ARM64 client; y is recovered from x.
- `0020-color-p3-red-is-wide-gamut.patch` - Armada, verbatim.
- `0100-realtime-queue-and-gamepad-cursor.patch` - this app, two of Armada's ported by hand onto
  3.16.29: realtime-priority Vulkan queues on request (`GAMESCOPE_FORCE_VULKAN_REALTIME=1`)
  without CAP_SYS_NICE, which proot can never have (a no-op on KGSL Turnip, which has a single
  submit-queue priority); and the gamepad-driven cursor sprite following the X pointer that XTest
  moves (it sat frozen). The X pointer is asked for only while a cursor image is drawn - every
  vblank while shown, every 50 ms while hidden for inactivity - since each ask is a blocking round
  trip to Xwayland on the paint thread; with no image, wlserver's position is used as upstream does.
- `0110-wayland-backend-touch.patch` - this app: the nested Wayland backend bound only the host's
  pointer and keyboard, so a finger on the phone's screen never reached Steam. It now binds
  `wl_touch` too and hands each finger to wlserver's touch path (`wlserver_touchdown` / `motion` /
  `up`) - the one a Steam Deck's touchscreen drives - so what a touch does follows the client's
  touch mode (Steam's Big Picture sets Passthrough: a real touch, rows scroll under a finger).
  Finger ids are offset by one, since the nested pointer already moves wlserver's touch 0.
- `0111-wayland-pointer-warps-in-passthrough.patch` - this app: the nested pointer's motion goes to
  wlserver as touch 0, and in Passthrough (Big Picture's touch mode) a motion for a touch that is not
  down moves nothing - so in the app's touchpad mode the Steam client saw no hover and a click landed
  wherever the pointer had last been. The motion now always warps the real pointer as well
  (`bAlwaysWarpCursor`), which the other touch modes did already.
- `0112-restore-iconified-game-on-resume.patch` - this app: the Steam menu is an overlay that
  takes input without changing the focus window, and a fullscreen wine game minimizes itself when
  it loses input. gamescope only takes a window out of iconic when the focus window changes, and
  wine will not activate a window it believes iconic, so after Resume the game stayed minimized: a
  black screen with its small caption in the top-left corner (Titanfall 2, GE-Proton 11). The
  iconify request is remembered and the window goes back to NormalState before input returns to it,
  then focus is handed over again. `GAMESCOPE_RESTORE_FOCUS_WINDOW` on the root window asks for the
  same restore from outside (the session script's resume watcher).
- `0114-take-override-redirect-from-mapnotify.patch` - upstream (ValveSoftware/gamescope 3829340),
  verbatim; drop it once the runtime's gamescope includes it. Wine creates a game's window
  override-redirect and makes it managed before mapping it, which sends no X event. When gamescope
  read the window's attributes first, it kept the window as override-redirect and left it out of
  `GAMESCOPE_FOCUSABLE_WINDOWS`, so the client kept its loading screen over the running game
  (Skyrim SE, A Plague Tale: Innocence, on the games' own Xwayland). MapNotify now refreshes the flag.

- `0120-nested-swapchain-capability-fallback.patch` - this app: nested Vulkan backends
  negotiate presentation IDs/waits and mutable swapchain support. Surfaces lacking mutable
  formats or storage usage receive copies from ordinary offscreen composition images, using
  the same command-buffer barriers and presentation-layout transition as direct composition.
  Swapchains respect advertised alpha modes, image counts and extents, and accept RGBA as well
  as BGRA. Without presentation waits, FIFO acquisition anchors estimated frame scheduling;
  it does not provide measured presentation timestamps. The build runs the capability-policy
  tests in `tests/nested-swapchain.cpp`; actual presentation still needs device validation.

`release.env` may set `GAMESCOPE_REPOSITORY` to fetch a component from a downstream repository
while retaining the configured source for the other APK assets. The archive remains SHA-256 pinned.

Sixteen more of Armada's patches are DRM/lease/HDR-on-KMS work for a native display, which this
app's Wayland-hosted gamescope never reaches, or need a newer gamescope than the runtime has.
